This is a CRUD web application created using the flask web framework.
It allows the user to add/remove/edit entries or "tasks" in a table. 
The application uses an SQLAlchemy database.

This is my first website created by following the youtube tutorial at this link:

to run the development version locally: python3 app.py
depends on flask and SQLAlchemy to run.
